This page describes an anatomically curated white matter atlas to enable consistent white matter tract parcellation across different populations (Zhang, et al, 2018). The atlas contains 58 deep white matter tracts including major long range association and projection tracts, commissural tracts, and tracts related to the brainstem and cerebellar connections, plus 198 short and medium range superficial fiber clusters organized into 16 categories according to the brain lobes they connect. In addition, the atlas contains a parcellation of the entire white matter into 800 fiber clusters. The atlas was  generated by creating dense tractography maps of 100 individual subjects and then applying a fiber clustering method to group the tracts across subjects according to their similarity in shape and location. The healthy normal human brains scans are  from 100 Human Connectome Project subjects. The resulting clusters of tracts were annotated using population-based brain anatomical information and expert neuroanatomical knowledge (Zhang, et al, 2018). The ORG-800FC-100HCP atlas is provided by the [O'Donnell Research Group (ORG)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/laurenjodonnell).

Usage:
---

* [Instructions](https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/ORG-Atlases#org-atlases) for downloading and visualizing the atlas
* [Instructions](https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis/wiki) for installing whitematteranalysis to apply the atlas
* [Instructions](<https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis/wiki/2c)-Running-the-Clustering-Pipeline-to-Cluster-a-Single-Subject-from-the-Atlas>) for applying the atlas for subject-specific tractography parcellation
* [Instructions](https://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography) for UKF tractography, on which the atlas is based. The atlas can be applied to streamline tractography in vtk format, with RAS (right-anterior-superior) coordinate system convention.
