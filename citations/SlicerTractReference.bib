# Instructions for updating citation list 
#
# Input one keyword (including ’Slicer Tractography’, ‘Slicer DTI’ and ‘SlicerDMI’) into GoogleScholar, and limit the search according to the publication years (e.g. since 2017). 
#
# For each searched paper, there is a brief introduction under the title. Check this description if it clearly says using Slicer to perform DTI processing, tractography or visualization.  For example, in reference (Bakhshmand, et al. 2017), there is a sentence “After that, 3D Slicer was used to create interim DTI images and compute the full brain tractography.” If it is not entirely clear from the brief description, find the full text of the paper and check. 
#
# After making sure that a reference cites SlicerDMRI, export the bib file from GoogleScholar. Check if the bibtex includes the full author list. For a paper with many authors, GoogleScholar cuts off the last few authors and use ‘others’ instead. If this happens, correct it by using the full author list. 
#
# Add the bibtex into the SlicerTractReference.bib file.
#
# After finishing search, commit the changes to the slicerdmri.github.io repository.
