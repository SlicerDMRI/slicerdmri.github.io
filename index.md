Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in 3D Slicer open-source software.

What can I do using SlicerDMRI?
---------------------
* Load DICOM and nrrd/nhdr diffusion MRI medical image data
* Perform tractography, compute scalar maps such as FA, and more
* Visualize, edit, and register multimodal data using 3D Slicer tools
* Access all functionality through the graphical user interface
* Perform command line batch processing
* Extended and improved SlicerDMRI functionality is coming soon...
