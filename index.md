SlicerDMRI is an open-source project to improve and extend diffusion magnetic resonance imaging software in 3D Slicer.

What can I do using SlicerDMRI?
---------------------
* Load DICOM and nrrd/nhdr diffusion MRI medical image data
* Perform tractography, compute scalar maps such as FA, and more
* Load and save tractography in new DICOM format 
* Visualize, edit, and register multimodal data using 3D Slicer tools
* Access all functionality through the graphical user interface
* Perform command line batch processing
