Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in 3D Slicer open-source software for visualization and image analysis. 

What can I do with the software?
---------------------
* Load DICOM and nrrd/nhdr diffusion MRI data
* Perform tractography, compute scalar maps such as FA, and more
* Visualize, edit, and register multimodal data using 3D Slicer tools
* Extended, improved, and refactored SlicerDMRI functionality coming soon...
